You'll need the following components:

- 18&times;24 LED Matrix, like [this one from Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/555). Should include ribbon cable.
- 2 Linear Potentiometers, like [these from Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/562) or [these from Jameco](https://www.jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10001&catalogId=10001&productId=2118791).
- 2 Light-dependent Resistors, like [this one from Jameco](http://www.jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product_10001_10001_202382_-1).
- 2&times; 10 k&Omega; resistors.
- 2 paperclips
- 2&times; 1 M&Omega; resistors.
- 10 wires.
- Solderless breadboard.
 
Preparing the LED Matrix board may also require a soldering iron to bridge jumper J5 on the back of the board. [See the Adafruit tutorial for details](http://learn.adafruit.com/16x24-led-matrix/wiring).
