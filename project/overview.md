# LED Matrix Graph

LED Matrix Graph is a simple program to track two physical values over time. Start with two potentiometers; variations replace the potentiometers with Light-dependent Resistors (LDRs), then with capacitive sensors. The two values are graphically represented on a 16x24 Red LED Matrix, like [this one from Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/555).

Requires minimal soldering skill; moderately complex programming.
